  <h1>Big-O</h1>
  <p>
    There isn't really much to say about Big-O. <br> 
    Yes, the full process of amortization for clock cycles could be covered, <br>
    But the entire point of the nomenclature is to avoid all that heady lifting. <br> 
    Unless of course, you are trying to go off rez and need to proof your solutions. <br>
    <hr> 
    The goal is to be efficient. <br>
    Less time spent. Less space used. <br>
    As with all things, tradeoffs will happen. <br> 
    But in general, from best to worst, <br> 
    We aim for space or time complexity of: 
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>O(1) <em>Constant</em> Algorithms of this such take the same amount of time, usually quite small, regardless of the number of inputs.</li>
    <li>O(log n) <em>Logarithmic</em> Grows, but very slowly, with the number of inputs.</li>
    <li>O(n) <em>Linear</em> Grows in size at the same rate of input growth</li>
    <li>O(n log n) <em>nlogn</em> Grows very fast</li>
    <li>O(n^2) <em>Quadratic</em> Grows very very fast. <strong>Rule of Thumb:</strong> nested loops almost always land here...</li>
    <li>O(n^3) And things only get worse from here.</li>
  </ol>

      We won't be kyping any more of the base content, although the code base will be earily similar. <br> 
      Let's face it, even though there are plenty of ways to skin a cat, only a few leave enough meat for a stir fry.

    <h2>Problem Solving:</h2>
    <p>Pretty common sense stuff here too.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Make sure you understand the problem. <em title="Yeah... but who determines what the right question is?">The perfect answer to the wrong question has little marketable value.</em></li>
      <li>Find a concrete example. <em>Nothing comes from Nothing. Relate or Locate an example to enhance understanding</em></li>
      <li>Break It Down. <em>Make note of your path</em></li>
      <li>Code! <em>Or continue breaking it down if you can't figure out a bit</em></li>
      <li>Optimize. <em>Yes, this is a final, and often optional, step. Having something that works is more useful than having nothing.</em></li>
    </ol>
